\title{Fast function using C++ to calculate the Colless index of (im)balance.}
\usage{
colless(phy, normalization = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{phylo object or ltable}

\item{normalization}{A character string equals to "none" (default) for no
normalization or one of "pda" or "yule".}
}
\value{
colless index
}
\description{
The Colless index is calculated as the sum of
\eqn{abs(L - R)} over all nodes, where L (or R) is the number of extant tips
associated with the L (or R) daughter branch at that node.  Higher values
indicate higher imbalance. Two normalizations are available,
where a correction is made for tree size, under either a yule expectation,
or a pda expectation.

\examples{
simulated_tree <- ape::rphylo(n = 10, birth = 1, death = 0)
brts <- branching_times(simulated_tree)
if (requireNamespace("nodeSub")) {
  balanced_tree <- nodeSub::create_balanced_tree(brts)
  unbalanced_tree <- nodeSub::create_unbalanced_tree(brts)
  colless(balanced_tree)
  colless(unbalanced_tree) # should be higher
